Skill / Capability Developed	What research have you conducted to determine this is a valued skill in the ICT industry?
(Dot points are appropriate.)
	Why is this important to you? Why might this be important in your future?
(Dot points are appropriate.)	What specific evidence do you have for this skill?
(Your evidence should be written in full with appropriate professional language and sentence structure.)
Time Management	Many developers mention huge amounts of unpaid overtime and “death marches” as some of the downsides of working as a software developer. Good Time Management would lead to less missed deadlines which employers’ value immensely.	Deadlines are very common in IT, and time management is the key part to meeting them. This is important because it is likely to result in me being a more productive employee, leading to better job opportunities and a higher salary.	Submission of functional web application assignments and exercises within deadlines despite taking 4 other subjects this trimester (total of 5), a constant unstable internet connection that almost doubled the amount of time needed to complete assessment within this unit, whilst juggling work commitments.
Individual and team work	Working independently is incredibly important when working within smaller teams, such as those employed by a startup. Whereas, working with larger teams requires an excellent ability to work in teams. 	Being able to work both independently and within teams, allows me to deliver solutions in whatever environment I find myself in, whether that be working alone in entrepreneurship or working with large teams. 	Throughout this unit, I have consistently completed assignments and exercises without further instruction other than that provided in the lectures. With this level of self-reliance, my ability to learn and work with software has been enhanced and my confidence as a software developer increased somewhat. 
Problem Solving	This transferable, non-technical skill is the core of software development; that is, to solve business problems with technology. Being an excellent problem solver is ubiquitous requirement for any kind of software development job.	Being an excellent problem solver means that I would be able to tangible problems in a shorter amount of time, increasing my value as a human resource to my employers	I have displayed my ability to problem solve effectively when faced with problems that could not be solved using the material provided in the content of this course. Often, I was forced to find alternative techniques, probe deeper into the course material, and think outside of the box in order to deliver a functional assessment item within the submission time.
Life long learning and curiosity 	Software development is unlike almost all other careers, as experience with specific technologies, and the technologies that employers value; can change several times over the course of a 45-50 year career. The ACS book of knowledge lists this.	Having developers that can learn quickly and effectively is a huge boon when new technologies need to be used to solve a business problem. This increases the value of employees that are able and motivated to learn new technologies when the role demands it.	I have learnt five/frameworks(php, html, cs, Laravel, sql) over the course of this unit, whilst simultaneously learning another four or so spread across other units. This was an incredible workload and showcases my ability to learn quickly and effectively.
Excellent Communication/Interpersonal
Skills (Most important)	Almost all seek job advertisements for web developers require this skill. Interacting with and observing fellow members of my cohort that lack this skill, despite the industry needing it the most, has also given me evidence that this skill is incredibly important to the industry and employers, as the supply for competent IT professionals with excellent communication is low.	The quality of Interpersonal relationships at a workplace have a huge impact on my future career trajectory. Co-workers, managers and stakeholders want to work with pleasant web developers to deliver solutions; not problems caused by bad communication.	I have increased my communication skills by conversing with lecturers and tutors in a polite and pleasant manner and adhering to social conventions in those interactions. Additionally, I have increased my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders during the explanation component of this unit’s assignments and labs.
